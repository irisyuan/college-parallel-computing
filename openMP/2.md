- openmp best with for loops
- default scope for variables declared before omp parallel are shared.
- private scope = visible per thread

- reduction clause improves just creating private var and critical sectioning any shared memory operation
- add reduction clause to parallel directive

reduction(<operator[+,*,-,&,etc]>: <variable list>)
must be commutative and associative - careful of subtraction and floating points

#pragma omp parallel for
- default private vars
- divide loop iterations among threads

fibo[ 0 ] = fibo[ 1 ] = 1;
for (i = 2; i < n; i++)
	fibo[ i ] = fibo[ i – 1 ] + fibo[ i – 2 ];


becomes


fibo[ 0 ] = fibo[ 1 ] = 1;
# pragma omp parallel for num_threads(2)
for (i = 2; i < n; i++)
	fibo[ i ] = fibo[ i – 1 ] + fibo[ i – 2 ]; 

but this might not work. openmp compiler can tell if there's data dependency
producing 0 0 0 0



openmp: declare scope explicitly for every variable
example: calculating pi. pragma omp parallel for num_threads (thread_count) \ default(none) reduction (+:sum) private(k,factor)
