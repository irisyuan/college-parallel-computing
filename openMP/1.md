1. Start with a parallelizable algorithm
• loop-level parallelism is necessary
2. Implement serially
3. Test and Debug
4. Annotate the code with parallelization
(and synchronization) directives
• Hope for linear speedup
5. Test and Debug


Atomic operations
– They are expensive
– Yet, they are fundamental building blocks.

• Synchronization:
– correctness vs performance loss
– Rich interaction of hardware-software tradeoffs
– Must evaluate hardware primitives and software algorithms together

All OpenMP programs begin with a single thread: master thread (ID = 0 )
FORK: the master thread then creates a team of parallel threads. 
JOIN: synch back
