- only use schedule directive if performance is unsatisfactory
• If each iteration requires roughly the
same amount of computation, default is
best
• If the cost of each iteration
increases/decreases linearly as the loop
execute, static with small chunksize
• If the cost cannot be determined, you
need to try several schedules:
schedule(runtime) and try different
options with OMP_SCHEDULE
