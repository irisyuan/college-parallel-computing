- processes compete for access to stdout; output is nondetermistic unless we have all processes send to proc 0 and proc 0 prints in rank order. the below can print out of order.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <mpi.h> 

int main(void) {
   int my_rank, comm_sz;

   MPI_Init(NULL, NULL); 
   MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &comm_sz); 
   MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &my_rank); 

   printf("Proc %d of %d > Does anyone have a toothpick?\n",
         my_rank, comm_sz);

   MPI_Finalize();
   return 0;
}  /* main */

- however, for input, only proc 0 can access stdin, so if we were to read from scanf proc 0 has to send data to all other procs



*** what are final values of variables after MPI_Reduce, etc? ***
*** when do you use point-to-point vs collective communication? ***
