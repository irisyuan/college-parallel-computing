goals of GPU - maintain execution speed of old sequential programs (CPU) and increase throughput of parallel program (GPU)

- SIMD

- need enough parallelization
- under utilized
- bandwidth to CPU

GPUs have more parallel units, CPUs have higher clock speeds

 scalar vs threaded --> see CUDA

*** know these ***
– data parallelism
– kernel, grid, block, and thread
– warp
